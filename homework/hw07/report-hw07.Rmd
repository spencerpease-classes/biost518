# _(Q1)_

```{r fig.cap="Casual diagram relating score, treatment, and behavior", out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/diagram.png")
```

# _(Q2)_

```{r}
resp_score_lrm <- regress("odds", response ~ score, data = prison)

resp_score_lrm2 <- glm(response ~ score, data = prison, family = "binomial")
resp_score_rse <- sqrt(diag(vcovHC(resp_score_lrm2, type = "HC1")))
```

```{r}
resp_score_inf <- resp_score_lrm %>%
  inference_table(include_intercept = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(`Pr(>|z|)` = format(`Pr(>|z|)`, digits = 3))

q2 <- list(
  as.numeric(resp_score_inf[2, 4:6]) %>% round(digits = 3),
  resp_score_inf[[2, 7]]
)

knitr::kable(
  resp_score_inf, booktabs = TRUE, digits = 3,
  caption = "Inferential statistics for the logistic regression of behavior response on score"
)
```

The coefficient of the score term (slope) is the log-odds ratio of the
associative relationship between score and misbehavior. On average, between two
groups with a one-unit difference in assigned score, the odds ($e^{\beta_1}$) of
a misbehavior event are `r q2[[1]][1]` (95% CI: `r q2[[1]][2]`, `r q2[[1]][3]`)
times higher in the higher-scored group. A _P_-value of `r q2[[2]]` suggests we
can reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between odds of
misbehavior and assigned score in favor of there being some statistically
significant difference.

# _(Q3)_

```{r}
resp_score_pred <-
  tibble(score = c(25, 50, 75)) %>%
  mutate(
    `prob. misconduct` = predict(resp_score_lrm2, newdata = ., type = "response")
  )

knitr::kable(
  resp_score_pred, booktabs = TRUE, digits = 3,
  caption = "Predicted probability of misconduct based on score"
)
```


# _(Q4)_

Yes, since treatment is known to affect behavior


# _(Q5)_

```{r}
resp_score_treat_lrm <- regress("odds", response ~ score * treat, data = prison)

resp_score_treat_lrm2 <- glm(response ~ score * treat, data = prison, family = "binomial")
resp_score_treat_rse <- sqrt(diag(vcovHC(resp_score_treat_lrm2, type = "HC1")))
```

## _(Q5.a)_

```{r}
resp_score_treat_inf <- resp_score_treat_lrm %>%
  inference_table(include_intercept = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(`Pr(>|z|)` = format(`Pr(>|z|)`, digits = 3))

q5a <- list(
  as.numeric(resp_score_treat_inf[2, 4:6]) %>% round(digits = 3),
  resp_score_treat_inf[[2, 7]]
)

knitr::kable(
  resp_score_treat_inf, booktabs = TRUE, digits = 3,
  caption = paste("Inferential statistics for the logistic regression of",
                  "behavior response on score, adjusted for treatment")
)
```

TBD

## _(Q5.b)_

```{r}
resp_score_treat_pred <- expand.grid(treat = 0:1, score = c(25, 50, 75)) %>%
  mutate(
    `prob. misconduct` = predict(resp_score_treat_lrm2, newdata = ., type = "response")
  )

knitr::kable(
  resp_score_treat_pred, booktabs = TRUE, digits = 3,
  caption = "Predicted probability of misconduct based on score and treatment"
)
```

# _(Q6)_

_(Optional)_

# _(Q7)_



# _(Q8)_
## _(Q8.a)_
## _(Q8.b)_
## _(Q8.c)_

# _(Q9)_

## _(Q9.a,b)_

For the question of interest, **mother's education** plays the role of a
_confounder_, while **baby's sex** plays is a _precision_ variable.

## _(Q9.c)_

```{r}
birth_lrm <- regress(
  "odds",
  low_bwt ~ age + factor(race) + education + sex,
  data = birth
)
```

```{r}
birth_inf <- birth_lrm %>%
  inference_table(include_intercept = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(`Pr(>|z|)` = format(`Pr(>|z|)`, digits = 3))

knitr::kable(
  birth_inf, booktabs = TRUE, digits = 3,
  caption = paste("Inferential statistics for the logistic regression of",
                  "low birth weight by age, adjusted for race, education, and sex")
)
```

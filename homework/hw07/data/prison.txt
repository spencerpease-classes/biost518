GENERAL EXPLANATION OF THE STUDY
================================

This data set is from a study by the California Department
of Corrections (CDC) on the effectiveness of prisoner placement,
and the likelihood of misconduct while incarcerated.  Because of
the cost of running high security facilities, it is important to
be able to sort inmates into different levels of risk and then 
place them into the lowest security level that eliminates risk to 
other inmates, staff and themselves.  The data included here can 
be used to examine how well those goals are achieved.

Most prisoners are assigned to a facility based on a classification 
score.  The classification score is based on the length of the 
sentence and other variables, including age, marital status and 
prior convictions.  There are, for most inmates, four levels of 
facilities to which one can be assigned.  A Level 1 facility has 
the lowest security and a Level 4 facility has the highest security.  
Level 4 facilities are reserved for the most dangerous prisoners, 
or prisoners who need protection from other inmates.  For this 
study, all the prisoners in the lower security Levels 1-3 are 
combined and compared to those assigned to Level 4 facilities.  
It should also be noted that this data set includes only prisoners 
assigned by a classification score.  Some prisoners are also assigned 
to a security level because of other issues or constraints, such as 
whether there are beds available, or because the offender is a 
particular risk if he escapes.

Classification System Using a Generalized Regression Discontinuity

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA
=============================
 
Beginning in January 1994, the CDC began enrolling inmates in this 
study.  A total of 3,922 inmates are included (only 3918 have 
classification scores).  The response variable indicates whether 
the prisoner committed any misconduct violations.  All incidents 
of misconduct were recorded, including less serious violations such 
as not standing for a count or not showing up for an assignment, as 
well as more serious violations, like drug trafficking or assaulting 
a corrections officer. A "Strike 2" inmate is a prisoner who is 
serving time for a second felony and who was sentenced under a 
California law mandating sentence length enhancements.  A "Strike 3" 
inmate is a prisoner who is serving time for a third felony, in which 
case that same law mandated a life sentence.  Since such prisoners have 
little to lose, they are usually assigned to the maximum (level 4) 
security prisons.  "Treat" whether a prisoner was assigned to a maximum security
(level 4) prison (the lower security levels 1-3 are 
combined into one level in this dataset).  This is an observational study, since the 
prisoners were not randomly selected and assigned.

Description of TUMORdata.txt

The Veterans Administration Cooperative Urological Research Group 
conducted a study on bladder cancer.  All subjects had superficial
bladder tumors when they entered the trial.  The tumors were first
removed.  Patients were then assigned randomly to one of three treatmetns:
placebo, thiotepa, and pyridoxine.  The data contain
recurrence times for Group 1 (placebo) and Group 2 (thiotepa).
Each recurrence time is measured from the beginning of treatment.
The effectiveness of thiotepa is to be evaluated from recurrence times
of patients in these two groups.

Each row in the dataset is 1 patient.
time:  the minimum of time to first recurrence or the end of follow-up
event=1 if time gives time to first recurrence, 0 otherwise
Group: 1=placebo  2=thiotepa
futime = follow-up time.  Inidicates how many monhths the patient is followed.
number = initial number of tumors.
size = Size of initial tumors.  Measured in centimeters.
rt1 = time (in months) that first tumor recurrence was observed.

For example, the first five patients in the dataset were in the placebo
group and were never observed to have a recurrent tumor.  The 6th
patient in the dataset had a recurrence at 6 months.
